# Finance

This repository includes the code that I use for all things related to investing. 'Finance' was created initially for optimal portfolio construction. The 'main' branch is the best
looking code I have that will comprise the most significant accomplishments, whereas additional branches contain the myriad messy code and various other files that went into and
are currently going into producing what exists within 'main.'

I hope to eventually have useful and far-reaching backtesting capability for many different facets of the stock market, bond markets, commidities and so forth.
